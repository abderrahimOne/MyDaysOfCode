# My Days Of Code - Log

## goals : master js, master react, learn canvas, master ts.

### Example

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link to work:** [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)
