      // start with strings, numbers and booleans

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.

      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      let copy = [...players];

      // however what happens when we update that array?
      players[0] = "me";
      console.log(players);
      console.log(copy);

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };
      let copy2 = { ...person };
      console.log(copy2);

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
